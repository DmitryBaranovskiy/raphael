# Raphaël: Cross-browser vector graphics the easy way.

Visit the library website for more information: [http://raphaeljs.com](http://raphaeljs.com/)

## Quickstart guide

* `git clone https://github.com/DmitryBaranovskiy/raphael.git`
* `git submodule init && git submodule update && cd dev && npm install`

## Dependencies
* [eve](https://github.com/adobe-webplatform/eve)
* [grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt)

## Loading
Check [Raphael-boilerplate](https://github.com/tomasAlabes/raphael-boilerplate) to see examples of loading.

Raphael can be loaded in a script tag or with AMD:

```js
define([ "path/to/raphael" ], function( Raphael ) {
  console.log( Raphael );
});
```

## Development

Versions will be released as we gather and test new PRs. Each version should have a correspondent branch.
As there are not automated tests, we will use the feedback from the users for the fixes.

You can use the `raphaelTest.html` to try things, you need to start a server in the root dir to start testing things there.
Something like running `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in the `raphael` directory and hitting `http://localhost:8000/dev/raphaelTest.html` with the browser.

## Want to contribute?

All changes in code must go to `raphael.core`, `raphael.svg` or `raphael.vml`.
`raphael.js` and `raphael-min.js` are generated files, generated after running `grunt` in the `dev` directory.

After changing the core/vml/svg files, execute `grunt` in the dev folder to generate the minified version, make a commit and you are ready to make a pull request!
Remember that if you want to add a functionality it must be present in the vml and svg versions, **no svg-only features will be accepted.**

## Found an issue?

First search for similar issues to make sure you don't repeat an existing one.

Then please create a fiddle ([jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/SSJJT/)) recreating the bug so we can find out what the problem is more easily (or be a hero and find it yourself and send a pull request!). You can also use the [raphael playground](http://raphaeljs.com/playground.html) to reproduce your issues.

Remember to add all the info that can be useful such as

* error details
* steps to reproduce
* browser and its version
* any suggestion of what do you think the problem could be
