## Found an issue?

First search for similar issues to make sure you don't repeat an existing one.

Then please create a fiddle ([boilerplate](http://jsfiddle.net/SSJJT/)) recreating the bug so we can find out what the problem is more easily (or be a hero and find it yourself and send a pull request!). You can also use the [raphael playground](http://raphaeljs.com/playground.html) to reproduce your issues.

Remember to add all the info that can be useful such as
